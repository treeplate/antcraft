## Naming
The 'ant' part of the name is for historical reasons:
At first my game was basically a snake game with no apples.
When I pointed it out to someone they said it was not a snake game but an ***ant*** game.
I may change the name.
## PRs
I am open to PRs, however, I am not especially likely to accept them.
